# Executive Summary

This report explores the use of Newton’s Method to solve for the implied volatility (IV) of a European call option, given a market price.

The objective is to demonstrate how a classic numerical technique can be applied in financial modeling to reverse-engineer market expectations using Python.

This project reflects a practical, hands-on application of numerical methods in a real-world financial context — cleanly implemented, modular, and ready for further extension.
