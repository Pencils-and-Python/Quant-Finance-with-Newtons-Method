# Problem Statement

Implied volatility is a key input to pricing derivatives, yet it is not directly observable in the market.

Given a market-observed option price, our goal is to find the value of volatility \( \sigma \) such that the Black-Scholes formula outputs that price:

\[
f(\sigma) = BS(\sigma) - P_{\text{market}} = 0
\]

This is a root-finding problem — and a perfect use case for Newton’s Method.
